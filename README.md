# Final Project for Practical Python Programming and Algorithms for Data Analysis (PHW2781L, Summer 2020)

## Redlining, Race-Exclusive Deed Restriction Language, and Neighborhood Racial Composition in Houston

[This report](https://github.com/aislyn/PHW2781L_FinalProject/blob/main/final_project.html) investigates the effects of systemic racism in Houston by examining  recent racial composition and racial composition changes of Houston neighborhoods intersected with historial geographic/race-based lending restriction (redlining) and race-based deed restrictions.
